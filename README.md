# Multiple-Disease-Prediction-System
Multiple Disease Prediction System using Streamlit

Built an interactive web-based application that predicts the likelihood of three major diseases—Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson’s Disease—using machine learning models integrated with a Streamlit frontend. This application allows users to input relevant medical parameters and receive real-time predictions.
 Key Features:
•	Developed a modular Streamlit interface with a sidebar navigation menu for seamless switching between disease prediction models.
•	Integrated pre-trained ML models:
o	Diabetes: Logistic Regression trained on PIMA dataset.
o	Heart Disease: Trained using Cleveland Heart Disease dataset.
o	Parkinson’s Disease: Trained using UCI Parkinson's dataset.
•	Utilized pickle for model serialization and efficient loading.
•	Created user-friendly input forms for collecting health data including vital signs, glucose levels, voice measurements, etc.
•	Generated real-time predictive feedback based on user input.
Tools & Technologies:
Python, Streamlit, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Pickle, Jupyter Notebook
Impact:
•	Designed to assist in early screening for critical illnesses.
•	Enhances accessibility for non-technical users to benefit from AI-driven healthcare diagnostics.
